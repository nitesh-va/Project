#  Django API for CRUD Operations

## Introduction

This guide provides a step-by-step process to build a Django project that enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities using the Django REST Framework (DRF) and Postman for API testing.

### What is Django REST Framework?

Django REST Framework (DRF) is a robust toolkit designed for developing RESTful APIs with Django. It streamlines the API creation process and includes features such as:

- **Serialization**: Converts complex data types into Python data structures suitable for API responses.
- **Authentication and Permissions**: Implements built-in authentication options to secure APIs.
- **Browsable API**: Offers a user-friendly web interface for developers to interact with APIs during development.

### Serializers in DRF

In DRF, serializers play a crucial role in transforming Django model instances into native Python types, which can then be rendered into formats like JSON.

#### Key Functions of Serializers:

1. **Serialization**: Converts model instances or querysets to JSON for API output.
2. **Deserialization**: Processes incoming JSON data and translates it back into Python objects or Django models.
3. **Validation**: Ensures incoming data adheres to defined formats before it is stored in the database.

#### Sample Serializer Code:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Student

class StudentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Student
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'roll_no']
```
# Setting Up URL Patterns

In Django Rest framework, URL patterns dictate the API endpoints, linking specific URL paths to views that handle CRUD operations.

### Example URL Configuration:
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import StudentListCreateView, StudentDetailView

urlpatterns = [
    path('students/', StudentListCreateView.as_view(), name='student-list-create'),  # Retrieve all students, Create
    path('students/<int:roll_no>/', StudentDetailView.as_view(), name='student-detail'),  # Retrieve, Update, Delete by ID
]
```
# Student Management API

This project implements an API to manage student information, including the following operations:

* Retrieve all students
* Retrieve a student by ID
* Create a new student
* Update a student by ID
* Delete a student by ID

### Defining the Student Model
The model for storing student data is defined as follows:
```python 
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    roll_no = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
# Implementing Views

The views contain the logic for handling CRUD operations using Data Rest Framework's generic views for efficiency.

#### 1. Retrieve All Students
```python
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from .models import Student
from .serializers import StudentSerializer

class StudentListCreateView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        students = Student.objects.all()
        serializer = StudentSerializer(students, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
```
#### 2. Retrieve a Student by ID
```python
class StudentDetailView(APIView):
    def get(self, request, pk):
        try:
            student = Student.objects.get(pk=pk)
            serializer = StudentSerializer(student)
            return Response(serializer.data)
        except Student.DoesNotExist:
            return Response({'error': 'Student not found'}, status=404)
```
#### 3. Create a New Student
```python
class StudentListCreateView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        serializer = StudentSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data, status=201)
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)
```
#### 4. Update a Student by ID
```python
class StudentDetailView(APIView):
    def put(self, request, pk):
        try:
            student = Student.objects.get(pk=pk)
            serializer = StudentSerializer(student, data=request.data)
            if serializer.is_valid():
                serializer.save()
                return Response(serializer.data)
            return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)
        except Student.DoesNotExist:
            return Response({'error': 'Student not found'}, status=404)
```
#### 5. Delete a Student by ID
```python
class StudentDetailView(APIView):
    def delete(self, request, pk):
        try:
            student = Student.objects.get(pk=pk)
            student.delete()
            return Response({'message': 'Student deleted successfully'}, status=200)
        except Student.DoesNotExist:
            return Response({'error': 'Student not found'}, status=404)
```
# Testing the API with Postman
Once the API is set up, you can test each endpoint using Postman by configuring requests for different operations—GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE—and inspecting the responses.

This approach allows for effective management of student data through Django and Django Rest Framework, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements.
